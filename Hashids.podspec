Hashids Implementation for Objective C

Generate short hashes from unsigned integers (like YouTube and Bitly).
* obfuscate database IDs
* use them as forgotten password hashes
* invitation codes
* store shard numbers
Hashids was designed for use in URL shortening, tracking stuff, validating accounts, or making pages private. Instead of showing items as `1`, `2`, or `3`, you could show them as `b9iLXiAa`, `EATedTBy`, and `Aaco9cy5`. Hashes depend on your salt value as well.
